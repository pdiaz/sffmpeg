# Static FFmpeg Build

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pyke369/sffmpeg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pyke369/sffmpeg)

`sffmpeg` is a simple cmake-based full-featured FFmpeg build helper.

It currently works on Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and MacOSX. It has been tested the most heavily on Linux/x86_64 (Ubuntu 14.04).
The helper will grab the latest versions of most FFmpeg dependencies, providing a way to effectively build, test and compare
multiple builds of FFmpeg on the same host.

## Requirements

`sffmpeg` requires:

- a POSIX-compliant system (virtually any system today).
- a recent version of [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/).
- a recent version of [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) (2.8.8+, with proper git and mercurial bindings).
- the [autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) and [libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) utilities.
- the [pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config) utility.

## Usage

Just type the following commands at the shell prompt:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyke369/sffmpeg
    $ cd sffmpeg
    $ make

Then go grab a coffee (or maybe two). The helper will download and compile all FFmpeg dependencies for you.
Once done, you should get a FFmpeg binary in the `build/bin` directory (with all dependencies statically linked-in).

    Use -h to get full help or, even better, run 'man ffmpeg'

From there, you may use the binary immediately or build a Debian package for later deployment (see below).

## Packaging
(requires devscripts package)

You may optionally build a Debian package by typing the following command at the shell prompt:

  $ make deb

The `ffmpeg` and i`ffprobe` binaries will be installed by the package in the `/usr/bin` directory.

  $ sudo dpkg -i sffmpeg_2.8.3_amd64.deb
  Selecting previously unselected package sffmpeg.
  Unpacking sffmpeg (from sffmpeg_2.8.3_amd64.deb) ...
  Setting up sffmpeg (2.8.3) ...


# Dockerfile builder

This Docker image will build a static version of `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` using [github.com/pyke369/sffmpeg](https://github.com/pyke369/sffmpeg).

The binaries are Linux binaries and will be stored in `/sffmpeg/build/bin`.

You must mount this directory to be get the binaries.

## Usage

The first step is to create a directory for the static binaries:

  ```
  $ mkdir ffmpeg-bin
  ```

Then you can start the build process:

  ```
  $ docker build . --name sffmpeg-builder && docker run --rm -v $PWD/ffmpeg-bin:/ffmpeg-bin sffmpeg-builder:latest
  ```

When the container will exit, you should have your Linux binaries in the `ffmpeg-bin` directory.
